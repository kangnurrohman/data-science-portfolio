After analyzing the data, we obtained a prediction accuracy of 65.64%. The results suggest that our model is capable of making reasonably accurate predictions, although there is still room for improvement. The study provides insights into the factors that impact house prices in these areas and demonstrates the utility of linear regression as a tool for analyzing real estate market trends. Future research could build upon this study by refining the model and exploring additional factors that may affect house prices. Overall, this experiment highlights the potential of linear regression for real estate forecasting and provides valuable insights into the housing markets of Jakarta and Tebet.","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Introduction\n\nIn recent years, the real estate industry in Jakarta and Tebet, Indonesia has experienced rapid growth, making it an interesting area for research and experimentation. One common task in this field is forecasting house prices, which can be challenging due to the complex and dynamic nature of the market. In this experiment, we will use linear regression, a widely used statistical method, to analyze data and make predictions about house prices in Jakarta and Tebet. By applying this technique, we aim to gain insights into the factors that affect house prices and improve our ability to forecast them accurately.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Literature review\n\n**Linear regression** is a statistical technique used to establish a relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Here are some pros and cons of linear regression:\n\nPros:\n\n* Simple to understand and easy to implement.\n* Useful for making predictions and forecasting future outcomes.\n* Provides a measure of the strength and direction of the relationship between the dependent and independent variables.\n* Helps identify the most significant independent variables that affect the dependent variable.\n* Allows for the examination of the effects of multiple independent variables on the dependent variable.\n\nCons:\n\n* Assumes a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables, which may not always hold true in reality.\n* Cannot be used to establish cause-and-effect relationships between variables.\n* Susceptible to outliers, which can significantly influence the outcome of the regression analysis.\n* Assumes the independence of the observations, which may not be true in some cases.\n* Cannot be used to analyze non-numeric data or categorical variables without some form of transformation.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Experiment","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Disable warning","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-14T10:49:39.84846Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-14T10:49:39.848919Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-14T10:49:39.879121Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-14T10:49:39.848878Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-14T10:49:39.878023Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Load data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.read_excel('/kaggle/input/daftar-harga-rumah/DATA RUMAH.xlsx', sheet_name='Sheet1')\ndf.info()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-14T10:49:39.880661Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-14T10:49:39.881596Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-14T10:49:40.573169Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-14T10:49:39.881557Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-14T10:49:40.571789Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- Explanation of each attribute:\n    1.
