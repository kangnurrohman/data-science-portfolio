# Data Science Portfolio

This repository contains data science projects that I have worked on in academics, personal experiments and self-study. Created using two languages, namely Python and R. Both are published on [Kaggle](http://kaggle.com/ainurrohmanbwx)

## Contents

- ### Natural Language Processing
   - __Python__
