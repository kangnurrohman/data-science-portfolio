# Data Science Portfolio

This repository contains data science projects that I have worked on in academics, personal experiments and self-study. Created using two languages, namely Python and R. Both are published on [Kaggle](http://kaggle.com/ainurrohmanbwx)

## Contents

- ### Natural Language Processing
   - __Python__
  
      - [Sentiment Analysis using BERT on Commodity News](https://github.com/kangnurrohman/data-science-portfolio/blob/b8dfb22d4c586dc7057316c4584f5fc14e97ff0a/Natural%20Language%20Processing/Sentiment%20Analysis/sentiment-analysis-using-bert-on-commodity-news.ipynb): An experiment to explore the use of sentiment analysis using BERT on news articles related to the commodity gold market.

         _Personal project | March 2023_ 

         _Tools: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, PyTorch, and Tensorflow_

- ### Data Analytics
  
   - __Python__
      - [Forecasting using Linear Regression on House Price](https://github.com/kangnurrohman/data-science-portfolio/blob/63ce0ebd9e17af3ed714a9a862bb8de53d24b49f/Data%20Analytics/forecasting-using-linear-regression-on-house-price.ipynb): Conduct exploratory data analysis on house price datasets in Jakarta and Tebet. Classical assumption tests for normality, multicollinearity, heteroscedasticity, and partial tests. Applying the regression model for predicting house prices in Jakarta.
